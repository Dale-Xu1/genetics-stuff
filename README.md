## Overview

`allele-concat`
This program is a user interface for selecting three alleles from a table for concatenation. It also adds colored-cored xyzw markers to the sequence.

`duplex-triplex-simulation`
This one conducts a probabilistic simulation of multiplex (only duplex and triplex are supported) drug administration given we know the probabilities of being able to treat each given condition.

`t-cell-gene-analysis`
This program reads a JSON file with annotated gene sequences (there is an example file `consensus_annotations.json`). It analyzes the sequence for rare codons and restriction enzymes and figures out which codons need to be swapped out for what to resolve the issue.
